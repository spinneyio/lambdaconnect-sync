# lambdaconnect-sync

Synchronisation library. <br> <br>
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/spinneyio/lambdaconnect-sync.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/spinneyio/lambdaconnect-sync)

## Installation

Leiningen coordinates:
```clojure
[io.spinney/lambdaconnect-sync "1.0.30"]
```

## Usage

Each function requires a config as the first argument. It can either be in the legacy form:

```
(def config {:log (constantly nil)
             :as-of d/as-of
             :pull-many d/pull-many
             :pull d/pull
             :q d/q
             :history d/history
             :tx->t d/tx->t
             :with d/with
             :basis-t d/basis-t})
```

or in the modern form:

```
(def config {:log (constantly nil)
             :driver *instance of database driver*})
```

The way to create datomic driver in the modern form is as follows:

```
(require '[lambdaconnect-sync.db-driver.datomic :as datomic-driver])

(def driver (datomic-driver/->DatomicDatabaseDriver 
                  {:log (constantly nil)
                   :as-of d/as-of                               
                   :pull-many d/pull-many
                   :pull d/pull
                   :q d/q
                   :history d/history
                   :tx->t d/tx->t
                   :with d/with
                   :basis-t d/basis-t}))
```

There may be more database drivers, for example in clojurescript/javascript world.
